I developed the web application using react js framework. I was able to get events from the json file and call the wethar API to 
get the weather for a particular city.

--How to Run---

1.Extract the folder to a new file location. 

2.Open VS code (Visual Studio code).

3.Open the extracted project folder.

4.In the VS code terminal run 'npm start' command to start the react app.

5.You can see the project output in the browser.

--Coding File---

** I have created 2 file to get events (WeatherEvents.js) and to get weather from API (API/GetWeather.js). For the styling Iused .css
file with the same name.
